                <strong> Your respiratory system</strong> is the network of organs and tissues that help you breathe. This system helps your body absorb oxygen from the air so your organs can work. It also cleans waste gases, such as carbon dioxide, from your blood.</dd>
            <dd>The respiratory system includes your airways, lungs and blood vessels. The muscles that power your lungs are also part of the respiratory system. These parts work together to move oxygen throughout the body and clean out waste gases like carbon dioxide.

            <dd> <em>The circulatory system (cardiovascular system) pumps blood from the heart to the lungs to get oxygen</em>. The heart then sends oxygenated blood through arteries to the rest of the body. The veins carry oxygen-poor blood back to the heart to start the circulation process over. Your circulatory system is critical to healthy organs, muscles and tissues.</dd>
            <dd>Your heart pumps blood to the body through a network of arteries and veins (blood vessels). Your circulatory system can also be defined as your <strong>cardiovascular system</strong>. Cardio means heart, and vascular refers to blood vessels.</dd>

            <dd>This is otherwise known as the <strong>digestive system</strong>.The gastrointestinal tract is a series of hollow organs that are connected to each other from your mouth to your anus.</dd>
            <dd>The gastrointestinal system includes the mouth, pharynx (throat), esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus. It also includes the salivary glands, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas, which make digestive juices and enzymes that help the body digest food and liquids.</dd>
