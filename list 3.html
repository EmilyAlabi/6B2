                <strong> Your respiratory system is the network of organs and tissues that help you breathe</strong> . This system helps your body absorb oxygen from the air so your organs can work. It also cleans waste gases, such as carbon dioxide, from your blood.</dd>
            <dd>The respiratory system is the network of organs and tissues that help you breathe. It includes your airways, lungs and blood vessels. The muscles that power your lungs are also part of the respiratory system. These parts work together to move oxygen throughout the body and clean out waste gases like carbon dioxide.

            <dt>circulatory system</dt>
            <dd> <em> The circulatory system (cardiovascular system) pumps blood from the heart to the lungs to get oxygen</em>. The heart then sends oxygenated blood through arteries to the rest of the body. The veins carry oxygen-poor blood back to the heart to start the circulation process over. Your circulatory system is critical to healthy organs, muscles and tissues.</dd>
            <dd> Your heart pumps blood to the body through a network of arteries and veins (blood vessels). Your circulatory system can also be defined as your <strong>cardiovascular system</strong>. Cardio means heart, and vascular refers to blood vessels.
